Error: input: NoneType in train.py and inference.py - not accessing file? but printing still gives tensor

Aggregating inference: 
track ID or filepath enough?
iterate:
for all with same trackID?  or for total_subgenre_track_chunks with trackID?

to do: 
preprocessing parallel pooling
make script for store multiple inferences 

changes:
no conversion to mel spec - done in train/inference
 csv to format (filepath, track_chunk_#, total_track_chunks, classID, Class)
