Questions:

Issue?
Data set is not evenly distributed amongst genres, trying to keep between 100-200 tracks.
Some track lengths are unnecessarily long, will  prediction on entire song take too long to be useful?
Converting to spectograms is taking too long a few minutes per track, can speed up somehow?
Is having the same compression for all data necessary? i.e. cut of at certain freq (above 20k)

For subgenre predictions, how to make conditional to genre? If not condtional, just output a second unrelated prediction?
