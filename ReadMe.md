Error: input: NoneType in train.py and inference.py - not accessing file? but printing still gives tensor

to do: 
preprocessing parallel pooling, csv to format (filepath, classID, Class)
dictionary/mapping ID? rather than if statements?
make script for store multiple inferences

notes:
no conversion to mel spec - done in train/inference
